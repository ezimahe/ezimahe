## About Me

👋 Hi, I’m Eleanor — a cybersecurity professional with 6+ years of experience specializing in security operations, threat detection, and incident response. I’ve worked extensively in SOC environments, using tools like Sumo Logic, Tenable Nessus, and Okta to monitor threats, reduce vulnerabilities, and enhance enterprise security postures.

🔍 I’m particularly strong in web application security, vulnerability management, and I enjoy tackling CTFs, digging into Linux based challenges, and understanding adversarial techniques to improve defense strategies.

💡 While my focus is currently on deepening my red team and application security skills, I’m also beginning to explore cloud security and automation to round out my defensive skillset.

🛠️ Technical Highlights:

Languages: Python, Bash, SQL

Tools: Wireshark, Nessus, Nmap, Sumo Logic, Okta, Kali Linux

Core Areas: Security Operations Engineering, Incident Response, Web App Security, Vulnerability Management, Cloud Security
